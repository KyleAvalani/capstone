## Problem Statement
With rapidly rising global temperatures, natural disasters displacing millions, and deforestation destorying the habitats of hundreds of millions of animals, there's no doubt that cilmate change is a massive issue today and will only continue to become more dangerous. We at Guardians of the Planet believe that one of the best ways we can work together to help combat climate change is by helping educate and inform the next generation, so that they are better equipped to tackle this issue.

Our proposed soluation is EcoCraft: a Minecraft mod to teach children about enviromentally sustability and activism. This mod will be available standalone for adding on to base Minecraft, and also coupled with a lesson plan we've designed with the help of science teachers to distribute through Minecraft Education. This offers children (and their teachers) a more structured, formal approach to the mod, while still tapping into the immense popularity of Minecraft and the incredibly fun nature of the game.

## What to expect here
* The source-code for our Minecraft EcoCraft mod
* Our detailed lesson plan for implementing this mod into Minecraft Education
